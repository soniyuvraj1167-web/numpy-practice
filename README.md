# NumPy Practice 🧮

This repository contains my NumPy practice work. I have created this repository to practice NumPy concepts step by step and upload my progress regularly.

## ✅ What I Have Done So Far

I have covered the following topics in my practice notebooks:

### **1. Array Creation & Basics**
* Created NumPy arrays using: `array()`, `zeros()`, `ones()`, `full()`, `arange()`.
* Worked with **boolean arrays**.
* Practiced **conditional operations** and filtering.

### **2. Array Manipulation**
* **Reshaping Arrays:** Converting 1D arrays to 2D using `.reshape()`.
* **Stacking Arrays:**
    * Vertical Stacking (`np.vstack`)
    * Horizontal Stacking (`np.hstack`)
* **Swapping & Reversing:**
    * Swapping specific rows and columns.
    * Reversing rows and columns in 2D arrays.

### **3. Mathematical & Set Operations**
* **Set Operations:**
    * Finding common items between arrays (`np.intersect1d`).
    * Removing specific items from an array (`np.setdiff1d`).
    * Finding matching positions (`np.where`).
* **Element-wise Operations:**
    * Finding the maximum element-wise between two arrays (`np.maximum`).
    * Replacing values based on conditions (odd/even checks).

### **4. Advanced Functions**
* **Random Number Generation:** Creating arrays with random decimals (`np.random.uniform`, `np.random.random`).
* **Formatting Output:**
    * Controlling decimal precision (`np.set_printoptions(precision=3)`).
    * Limiting the number of printed elements (`threshold`).
